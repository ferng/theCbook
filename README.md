# the C book
* I found this in a zip file on a backup drive. it goes back to 2010.
* I went through this book when I was little (before there was an ANSI C standard).
* Then I went through it a few years ago to see how it faired against modern languages (and because I'd probably forgotten some of it).
* I'm still amazed by how clean and lean the language is, I think I want to go back to it but this time for a living.
